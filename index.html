                <h3>What is Hacking Transition?</h3>
                <p>Hacking Transition is a web application for tracking transitioning service members' progress through
                    transitioning out of the military. The application implements both an admin view as well as a
                    student view. The admin view allows for anyone with admin rights to have access to view all the
                    students' progress, send messages to individual students, add students, remove students, edit
                    students, add cohorts, remove cohorts, and edits cohorts. The student view allows the students to
                    update their individual progress, edit their own account, and message the admins. </p>
                <h3>What technologies does Hacking Transition use? </h3>
                <p>Hacking Transition uses React for its frontend, Node.js/Express for its server, and PostgreSQL for
                    its database. As for the messaging aspect of the application, Socket.IO was used in order to
                    implement real time messaging. Lastly, authentication was accomplished by using bcrypt.</p>
                <h3>What was I personally responsible for?</h3>
                <p>This entire application was developed with a team of 6 of my fellow software engineers during my time
                    at Galvanize Inc. We worked together in an AGILE environment to collaborate, design, build, and
                    deploy our application. I personally was responsible for the authentication, instant messaging, and
                    the create account modal. For the authentication, I utilized bcrypt in order to hash the password
                    and then store it in the database. Upon an attempted login, the password sent to the server would
                    then be compared to the hashed password in the database to see if it matched. As for the instant
                    messaging, I worked in collaboration with a fellow software engineer to implement Socket.IO in order
                    to get real time messaging implemented into our application.</p>

                <h3>What is Ketchup?</h3>
                <p>Ketchup is a web application that allows you to post to different forums similar to Reddit. You can
                    either create a new post in a sub forum that already exists or you can create an all new sub forum
                    with your own banner image and name. It allows for not only posting text, but images as well.</p>
                <h3>What technologies does Ketchup use?</h3>
                <p>Ketchup uses React for its frontend, Node.js/Express for its server, and PostgreSQL for its database.
                    Avatars and images are stored in an AWS S3 bucket, where their URL to access them is stored in the
                    database. Finally, authentication was accomplished using bcrypt.</p>
                <h3>What was I personally responsible for?</h3>
                <p>This entire application was developed by a team of 4 other software engineers during my time at
                    Galvanize Inc. During the development of this application, our team stuck to an AGILE methodology in
                    order to quickly and efficiently build Ketchup. Personally, I was responsible for the authentication
                    and images. For the authentication, I used brcypt to hash the password before it was stored in the
                    database, then that hashed password is compared to the password sent from the frontend when a login
                    was attempted. As for the images, an image is sent from the frontend using form data, that form data
                    is then sent to the backend where a middleware called "multer" would handle the form data and allow
                    that form data be sent to the S3 bucket using Amazon's AWS SDK. Finally, the image URL is stored in
                    the database. I found doing it this way was more efficient than storing the images directly in the
                    database, allowing the application to run much more efficiently.</p>

                <p>Hi, my name is <b>Brandon Shapiro</b> and I'm a passionate full stack software engineer who loves to
                    problem solve and learn new concepts everyday. I enjoy the challenges associated with being a
                    software engineer and I believe no problem is too difficult or daunting. I recently graduated from an 18 week software engineering immersive where I was exposed to over 1000 hours of coding. Primarily, we focused on building out full stack web applications using the PERN stack in an AGILE environment. In addition to being a
                    software engineer, I'm also a father of 4 kids, a husband, and a US Army veteran.</p>
