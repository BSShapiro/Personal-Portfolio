                <h3>What is Hacking Transition?</h3>
                <p>Hacking Transition is a web application for tracking transitioning service members' progress through transitioning out of the military. The application implements both an admin view as well as a student view. The admin view allows for anyone with admin rights to have access to view all the students' progress, send messages to individual students, add students, remove students, edit students, add cohorts, remove cohorts, and edits cohorts. The student view allows the students to update their individual progress, edit their own account, and message the admins.  </p>
                <h3>What technologies does Hacking Transition use? </h3>
                <p>Hacking Transition uses React for it's front end, Node.js/Express for it's server, and PostgreSQL for it's database. As for the messaging aspect of the application, Socket.IO was used in order to inplement real time messaging.</p>
                <h3>What was I personally responsible for?</h3>
                <p>This entire applciation was developed with a team of 6 of my fellow software engineers during my time at Galvanize Inc. We worked together in an AGILE environment to collaborate, design, build, and deploy our applciation. I personally was responsible for the authentication, instant messaging, and the create account modal. For the authentication, I utilized bcrypt in order to hash the password and then store it in the database. Upon an attempted login, the password sent to the server would then be compared to the hashed password in the database to see if it matched. As for the instant messaging, I worked in collaboration with a fellow software engineer to implement Socket.IO in order to get real time messaging implemented into our application.</p>
